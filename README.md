## About Review Project

This project intends to implement a Review service. I'm using the task to show how I would normally approach a Laravel project.
I also want to show my practices on Git flows, writing tests, using static analyzers, utilizing automatic code style checks, adding GitHub workflows as the CI and writing documentation for the project.

## Tools
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) as admin panel builder.
- [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pint) as code style fixer.
- [Pest](https://pestphp.com) for writing tests.
- [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for running static analyzes.
- [Pest's Type Coverage plugin](https://pestphp.com/docs/type-coverage) for checking %100 type coverage.
- [Scribe](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/) for generating API documentation.

## GitHub workflows
- [Pint](/.github/workflows/pint.yml) for code style checks.
- [Tests](/.github/workflows/tests.yml) for running the test suite.
- [Static](/.github/workflows/static.yml) for running static analyzes workflows (PHPStan and Pest type coverage).

## Setup
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dependencies
- [PHP 8.3](https://www.php.net/releases/8.3/en.php)
- [Composer v2](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

### Getting Started
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/fsamapoor/product-review-service.git

cd review

composer install

cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate

php artisan migrate --seed

php artisan db:seed --class=ReviewSeeder

php artisan serve
```

### API Endpoints
| Method   | Route                                        | Description                    |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/products`                              | Get all products.              |
| `POST`   | `/api/products/:productId/reviews`           | Create a review for a product. |

### API Documentation
Visit `APP_URL/docs` to see the API documentation, generated by Scribe.

### Testing
``` bash
composer test
```

### Admin panel credentials
Once the admin user is seeded, you can log in to the dashboard (`APP_URL/admin/login`) using:
- email address: admin@fsamapoor.dev
- password: FilamentRocks!

### TODOs:
- Developing remaining REST endpoints.
- Improving the test-suite.
- Containerizing the application.
- Implementing authentication.
- Implementing authorization.
- Adding a new workflow to auto-generate API docs.
- Introducing caching layer to product index.
- Adding GitHub workflow for auto-generating Scribe documents.
- Adding the logic to buy the products.
